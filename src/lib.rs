/// Package duplo-rs provides tools to efficiently query large sets of images for
/// visual duplicates. The technique is based on the paper "Fast Multiresolution
/// Image Querying" by Charles E. Jacobs, Adam Finkelstein, and David H. Salesin,
/// with a few modifications and additions, such as the addition of a width to
/// height ratio, the dHash metric by Dr. Neal Krawetz as well as some
/// histogram-based metrics.
/// 
/// Quering the data structure will return a list of potential matches, sorted by
/// the score described in the main paper. The user can make searching for
/// duplicates stricter, however, by filtering based on the additional metrics.
/// 
/// This project is a reimplementation of the project https://github.com/rivo/duplo
/// in rust.
/// 
/// It is intended for recurring runs and for finding similar parts in videos.
/// So the data structures will be different.
